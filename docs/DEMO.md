### Demo Flow

#### Step 1: Initial Connection

```
Narrator: "Let's start our morning by checking what's happening on WhatsApp using our AI assistant."

User: "Good morning! Can you analyze my WhatsApp messages from the last 24 hours?"

AI Agent: "Good morning! I'll analyze your recent WhatsApp messages and organize them for you..."
```

#### Step 2: Message Analysis

```
AI Agent: "Here's your WhatsApp activity summary:

| Category | Topic | Action Items | Deadlines | Contacts |
|----------|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Business | Q1 Planning | Review budget proposal, Schedule team meeting | Jan 15 | Sarah Chen |
| Business | Client Project | Send updated mockups, Confirm timeline | Jan 14 | Mark Johnson |
| Business | Partnership | Review contract terms | Jan 16 | Legal Team |
| Social | Birthday Party | Buy gift, RSVP | Jan 20 | Emma Wilson |
| Social | Gym Plans | Confirm morning session | Tomorrow | Jake Miller |

I've identified 3 business items requiring immediate attention and 2 social commitments."
```

#### Step 3: Voice Summary Request

```
User: "Can you give me a voice summary of the most important items?"

AI Agent: "Creating a voice summary for you..."

[ElevenLabs generates audio]

Voice Output: "Good morning! You have three urgent business items today. First, you need to send updated mockups to Mark Johnson for the client project by end of day. Second, review the budget proposal for Sarah Chen before the January 15th deadline. Third, don't forget to review the partnership contract terms by January 16th. For social items, remember to confirm your gym session with Jake for tomorrow morning."
```

#### Step 4: Detailed Investigation

```
User: "Show me more details about the client project with Mark Johnson"

AI Agent: "Here are the recent messages with Mark Johnson about the client project:

**Yesterday 3:47 PM**
Mark: "Hey, the client loved the initial concepts! Can we get the updated mockups with their feedback incorporated by tomorrow EOD?"

**Yesterday 3:52 PM**
You: "Sounds great! I'll work on those changes tonight."

**Yesterday 6:23 PM**
Mark: "Perfect. Also, they're asking about the timeline for the full implementation. Can you include that with the mockups?"

**Yesterday 6:25 PM**
Mark: "No rush on the timeline if you need until Friday, but mockups would be great by tomorrow üëç"
```

#### Step 5: Taking Action

```
User: "Send a message to Mark letting him know I'll have the mockups ready by 3 PM today"

AI Agent: "I'll send that message to Mark Johnson for you."

[Message sent]

AI Agent: "‚úì Message sent to Mark Johnson: 'Hi Mark! Just wanted to update you - I'll have the updated mockups ready by 3 PM today. I'll include the implementation timeline as well. Thanks for your patience!'"
```

#### Step 6: Quick Status Check

```
User: "Have I missed any urgent messages this morning?"

AI Agent: "Checking for new messages since our last analysis...

You have 2 new messages:
1. **Sarah Chen** (8:45 AM): "Can we move our meeting to 2 PM instead of 3 PM?"
2. **Jake Miller** (8:52 AM): "Confirmed for gym at 6 AM tomorrow! üí™"

The meeting time change with Sarah Chen requires your confirmation."
